**NativePin** ("the App") is developed and maintained by **Nativewit Technologies Private Limited** ("we", "us", "our").  
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.

## 2. Data Collection

**NativePin is 100% offline.** We do **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal data on our servers or third-party services.

- **Location Data**: All latitude/longitude conversions are performed locally on your device; no coordinates leave your device.

- **User-Provided Data**: Any text or files you import/export remain solely on your device or in your chosen cloud storage; we have no access.

## 3. Third-Party Services

Although NativePin does not transmit data, the App may rely on:
- Open-source libraries
- In-app purchase frameworks (App Store / Play Store)

These services may collect minimal metadata under their own policies.  
Please consult Apple/Google documentation for further details.

## 4. Children’s Privacy

The App is **not directed to children under 13**.  
We do not knowingly collect information from minors.

## 5. Security

All processing occurs locally.  
Sensitive data (e.g., stored pin history) can be encrypted using device-level encryption mechanisms, such as:
- **Android Keystore**
- **iOS Keychain**
